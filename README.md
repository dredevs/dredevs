### Hey!  <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Andres**](https://aalvarez.cc), a self-taught software developer and multimedia specialist based in California.

I am currently a college student, majoring in computer science and minoring in film production, and have developed a minecraft network that accumulated 200+ concurrent players.

I primarily focus on backend infrastructure, large-scaled projects, and have used numerous programming languages to support my projects, as well as databases.

Outside of college and work, I enjoy playing sports, playing video games, and freelancing in the videograpy/photgraphy field.
